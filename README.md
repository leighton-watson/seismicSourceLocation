# seismicSourceLocation
Locate seismic source by considering decay of seismic amplitude with distance.

This code uses an amplitude decay method (e.g., Cannata et al., 2013) to locate seismic sources. THe method is applied to track the movement of pyroclastic density current at Mt. Etna in 2014. The method and results are presented in Watson et al. (2013) Tracking a pyroclastic density current with seismic signals at Mt. Etna (Italy), Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.
